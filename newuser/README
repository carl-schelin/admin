The numbered files are copies of the e-mails sent to the new users. It might be used as a template if you are 
creating new users.

The project files are lists of servers used for that project. Add as necessary.

Add new users to the "newuser.users" file. Six fields separated by colons.

Fields:

1: The account id. First initial and last name up to 8 characters typically.
2: The user's first and last name. Initial cap the names and separate the names with an underscore vs a space (Carl_Schelin)
3: The user's e-mail address. Just the left side of the @. The rest is added in the script
4: If you are using another account as an example, put this account name here. If you don't fill this field, cschelin is the default.
5: Group the user can be added to. This can be blank.
6: The uid. If you wanted to specify a UID that's common across all servers, set the number here (like 5000)

Copy all the newuser files to the server in /tmp. Log in to the server and sudo to root. Run /tmp/newuser. 
This script runs through the /tmp/newuser.users file, splits up the fields and runs /tmp/newuser.add with 
the appropriate parameters.
